          <p>My name is Ben and I was born in the early 2000's in sin city, but raised in southern California. Growing up for me was easy as I lived in the suburbs, where not much went on.
            My parents were immigrants from the Philippines and grew up here in America with little to no money. They did their best keeping me out of the ghetto and raised a spoiled kid.
            Even though they didn't have much money and raised four kids they always were able to buy me the things I wanted. Being spoiled though did come to bite me in the ass. 
            I never learned how to work for the things I wanted so now that I'm legally a grown man, my life experiences I feel are very poor. Bringing it back to when I was teen, I never really
            tried to make new friends and be outgoing. I wasn't really a weird kid but back then, I convinced myself that I was somehow going to better then the kids in school. This kind of hurt my social
            skills but I think I'll be fine. I didn't like school like most kids and was very kept to myself. I also played lots of video games which also didn't help a lot with my social life. 
            Around some time in high school I fell in love with Hip Hop and music and would watch videos on my favorite rappers. In my senior year of High School, I loved Hip Hop a lot and bought 
            FL Studio, which is a app to make beats, got on it once and never touched it again. 
          </p>
          <p>Later, after High School I graduated and COVID was at it's peak and I found myself stuck in life. In High School I had dreams of becoming financially successful and becoming a cool
            internet personality that makes music and stuff. I never put in the work during those times and I just found myself in the regular system. Going to college I would hate myself because I knew 
            it was the easy option but still hard to do. I promised to myself that I would somehow make without college with no real plan on how. I was hating everything. I would procrastinate, gain weight, and 
            hate myself everyday because I knew I wasn't taking action in becoming who I wanted. I was stuck in a rut. Around this time anime found it's way into my life after I stopped watching it Middle School. The most important ones
            I watched were Evangelion, FLCL, and Mushoku Tensei. I would say that these three anime helped realize that something was wrong with me and that I could change. Evangleion resonated with me because of how it
            tackles the feelings of wanting to dissapear and the feeling of not being enough. FLCL showed me that it's okay to be confused in this world and to try and be true to yourself. And Mushoku Tensei showed me that it's never too
            late to change and to find your why in life. Although these anime did help me through the pandempic, it would still take some time for me take true action.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this little rut I would explore more ways to expend all my down feeling by listening to more music. I would listen to a bunch of stuff, mostly Hip Hop, but I would venture into the expirmental, alternative scene. I ended up listening 
            to a lot of Earl Sweatshirt, Mavi, Mike, and other artists like them. Listening to them I was able to really get out my feelings about myself and the stuff around me. A lot of the entertainment that I consumed no longer felt like entertainment.
            It was all starting to become ways to express myself and my emotions. I fell in love with this feeling and have been feeling the need to share the way these pieces of media have made me feel. These things became art to me and lead me to want to 
            become a better person. It took time for me to take action in my life but as of now I've decided to make some kind of change in it. I've dabble in beat making and plan to release later in 2022. I started a web development course and hope to finish
            it by the start of next year. I also started working out like a week ago again and hope to keep doing it consistently, fingers crossed. I know this little essay kind of sucked but I'm practicing HTML and making this essay feels kind of nice.
